### User Stories
- As a user, I would like to view different photos that interest me.
- As a user, I would like to click on a single photo to expand it and also view the details of the photo.
- As a user, I would like to search for different categories of photos.
- As a user, I would like to POST a picture so to other users to see when they login.
- As a user, I would like to view photos and leave comments.

### Behavior Driven Development
- The application should display photos.
- When a user clicks on a photo, the photo should expand and the details of the photo to be displayed on a modal within the main page.
- When a user enters a search term on the search input and submits it, then they should be able to get a result of what they are looking for or if the term does not exist, they should get a message to inform them.
- When a user clicks on a picture, the picture displays separately from in another page whereby you can leave your comment there.
